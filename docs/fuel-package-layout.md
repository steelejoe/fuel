# FUEL Package Layout

A FUEL package is a zip container containing a few standard files and at least one sub folder.
The default compression method supported is **DEFLATE** although I plan to include support for LZMA/XZ soon.

The minimum required layout looks like this.

**ROOT**
- manifest.json
- signature.json
- { server-name }
- apps
